# Explaining-Homogamy-Decline
This is a replication package for my paper titled Explaining Declining Trends in Educational Homogamy in Japan: The Role of Institutional Changes in Higher Education. Data are drawn from the Japanese Panel Survey of Consumers and Keio Household Panel Study. On the basis of these data, I created a cross-tabulation of husband's education, wife's education, and marriage cohorts (log.tmp5cat3timec.txt, stored in 1.Data). Codes used to estimate the log-linear and log-multiplicative models are stored in 2.Codes. Results are available in 3.Results. Finally, figures can be seen in 4.Figures.
